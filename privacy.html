<h1>Privacy Policy - May 2016</h1>

<p>
Cohort helps you find the people you need, through the people you already know.  The whole point of Cohort is that it allows for development of meaningful professional relationships. That means that it’s not possible to be anonymous. We look at data that exists about you publicly online, and privately, where you give us access. 
</p>
<p>
We use this data to find out who you know, and in turn, who those people know. We also use this data to figure out what people know, in terms of skills, abilities, and expertise. When you tell Cohort that you need help with something, we make recommendations based on who we think is most capable of helping, and how well they know someone you know.
</p>
<p>
This requires a level of trust on your part, and this is something that we do not take lightly. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Information we collect when you use Cohort</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What you give us from your data sources</li>
	<li>What we get from your use of Cohort</li>
    <ul>
			<li>We use Google Analytics to track aggregated activity across our web interfaces</li>
    	<li>We use Intercom to track user activity and to communicate directly with individuals and groups of users.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
		
<h2>How we use this information</h2>
<p>
We use this information to build, maintain and improve the Cohort service. We do not share information that you have privately given us with third party individuals or organisations, beyond how that information is used in the running of the Cohort service. For example, we will use information you have privately given us, in conjunction with publicly available information about you, to better rank or recommend your relationships or skills to other Cohort users. But we will not package up or sell your data to third parties, including marketing or recruitment companies. 
</p>

<h2>Our Privacy Principles</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Your data is your data - any data that you bring to the party on signup remains yours.</li>
	<li>You can remove this data yourself from Cohort at any time. While there is no automated way to do this right now, this is a feature that is on our roadmap and will be built in due course. In the meantime, if you want your personal data removed from Cohort, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@cohort.is">privacy@cohort.is</a> </li>
	<li>Any data that’s generated from your use of Cohort belongs to Cohort, as optimal operation of the service relies on it, but it will be available for you to download at any time.
